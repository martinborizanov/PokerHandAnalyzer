# Poker Hands

From Rosetta Code:

  Task
  Create a program to parse a single five card poker hand and rank it according to this list of poker hands.
  A poker hand is specified as a space separated list of five playing cards.

  Each input card has two characters indicating face and suit.   For example:   2d   (two of diamonds).

  Faces: A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K
  Suits: H (hearts), D (diamonds), C (clubs), and S (spades)

  Duplicate cards are illegal.

  The program should analyze a single hand and produce one of the following outputs:
   * straight-flush
   * four-of-a-kind
   * full-house
   * flush
   * straight
   * three-of-a-kind
   * two-pair
   * one-pair
   * high-card
